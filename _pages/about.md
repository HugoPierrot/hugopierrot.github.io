## Who Am I ?

I am a French PhD student in my third year, specializing in magmatic petrology, with a particular focus on U-Pb geochronology (zircon and apatite), geochemistry (major and trace elements, as well as isotopes, both on whole-rock and mineral scales), and petrography. My thesis focuses on the petrographic, geochemical, and geochronological diversity of the Paleozoic basement of the Morvan (NE part of the French Massif Central). I carry out my research at the GEOPS laboratory (Geosciences, Paris-Saclay), under the supervision of [Jocelyn Barbarand](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jocelyn-Barbarand) and [Marc Poujol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-poujol-67a01b171/), and co-supervised by [Carlos Pallares](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos-Pallares).

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been passionate about natural disasters — how they work, why they happen, and how we can prevent them. Earth-related phenomena such as volcanoes and earthquakes have always held a special place in my heart, which is why I wanted to study their various aspects. I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Geology (Université Paris-Saclay), followed by a Master's in Earth-Related Natural Hazards (IPGP, France), during which I focused on seismic and volcanic risk communication in Mayotte, and how to improve it. Finally, I began my current PhD on the geodynamics of the Morvan, to better understand why such phenomena exist.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and I am currently looking for a postdoctoral position in geochemistry, petrography, and geochronology within convergent settings (orogenesis, subduction), in order to continue my exploration of the world of volcanoes and mountains.

## A summary of my scientific research topic

As outlined in my profile, I study the Paleozoic basement of the Morvan region (NE part of the French Massif Central) using petrography, geochemistry, and geochronology. This research has led me to dig into the geological past of the Variscan orogeny (420–280 Ma) in the region, revealing deep partial melting processes, acidic crustal-derived volcanism, and plutonism within a continental collision setting. These phenomena appear to be driven by crust–mantle interactions, which are still actively debated within the scientific community.

My work has been presented (through posters and talks) at several conferences: the SGF meeting in 2022, Goldschmidt (Lyon) and RST (Rennes) in 2023, and the upcoming EGU in Vienna in 2025. It has also led to three research articles: on mantle-derived plutonism (submitted, currently under revision); on Carboniferous acidic volcanism linked to crustal partial melting (work in progress); on the Morvan granitoids, proposing a 50-million-year geodynamic evolution of the region during the Variscan cycle (work in progress).
